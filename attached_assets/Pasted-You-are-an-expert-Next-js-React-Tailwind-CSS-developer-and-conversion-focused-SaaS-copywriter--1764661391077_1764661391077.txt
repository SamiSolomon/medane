You are an expert Next.js + React + Tailwind CSS developer and conversion-focused SaaS copywriter.

Build a responsive `/product` page for a B2B SaaS called "Current". Current is a self-updating knowledge base that keeps SOPs and internal docs in sync with Slack, Zoom, and Google Docs using AI.

Requirements:
- Use a clean, modern, opinionated layout similar to Linear/Notion.
- Use Tailwind classes for styling (no external UI libraries).
- Structure the page into these sections:
  1) Hero
     - Headline: “Your knowledge base that updates itself.”
     - Subheadline explaining that Current ingests Slack, Zoom, and docs, detects knowledge drift, and suggests AI-powered updates.
     - Two buttons: “Get started free” (primary) and “Book a demo” (secondary).
  2) Problem → Solution
     - A two-column section.
     - Left: the problem of knowledge rot: stale SOPs, outdated Notion/Confluence pages, real answers buried in Slack and meetings.
     - Right: how Current continuously watches Slack/Zoom/docs and keeps a single source of truth updated.
  3) Feature Cards
     - A grid of feature cards with icons and copy.
     - Features to include:
       - Auto-updating docs
       - Slack ingestion
       - Zoom & meeting transcription
       - Doc diffing and version history
       - AI update suggestions & approvals
       - Knowledge drift detection
  4) Screenshot / UI Preview Section
     - A faux “app preview” card showing a list of documents with status (Up to date / Needs review), and a diff panel with red/green changes.
     - This can be a simple styled div; no real image needed.
  5) Social Proof / Trust
     - Placeholder logos and a small testimonial quote from an “Ops Lead” about saving hours per week keeping docs in sync.
  6) Final CTA
     - Restate the value.
     - Buttons: “Get started free” and “Talk to us”.

Implementation details:
- Export a default React component for the page (e.g. `export default function ProductPage()`).
- Use semantic HTML where possible (`<main>`, `<section>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`).
- Keep copy clear, concise, and focused on mid-market ops / CS / RevOps buyers.
- Assume this will be used in a Next.js app under `/app/product/page.tsx` or `/pages/product.tsx`, so just export the component, no routing logic.
