You are an expert in UX writing and Next.js + Tailwind CSS. Build a `/how-it-works` page for a SaaS product called "Current".

Current = an AI-powered, self-updating knowledge base. It ingests Slack, Zoom, and docs, detects when documentation is out of date, and suggests AI-generated updates that users approve with one click.

Page structure requirements:
1) Hero section
   - Headline: “How Current keeps your knowledge always up to date.”
   - One-sentence explanation.
   - A subtle link back to “Get started free”.

2) 4-step visual flow
   - A horizontal or vertical stepper with four clear steps:
     Step 1: Connect your tools (Slack, Google Docs, Notion, Zoom).
     Step 2: Current listens for changes (messages, meetings, edits).
     Step 3: AI compares everything to your SOPs and knowledge base, detects drift, and generates diff-style suggestions.
     Step 4: You approve updates with one click and your source of truth stays in sync.
   - Each step should have:
     - A step number
     - A short title
     - 2–3 lines of explanatory copy
     - A small icon-like visual (Tailwind-styled divs, no external images required).

3) Under-the-hood section
   - A two-column section:
     - Left: high-level explanation “What’s happening behind the scenes” in non-technical language: ingestion, embeddings, diffing, approvals.
     - Right: a simple pseudo-diagram (stacked cards or boxes) labelled “Slack”, “Zoom”, “Docs”, “Current AI Engine”, “Knowledge Base”.
   - This should feel reassuring, not overly technical.

4) “Who it’s for” strip
   - A row of 3–4 pill cards: Ops teams, Customer Success, RevOps, Agencies.
   - Short copy under each describing what Current does for them.

5) Final CTA
   - Short line like “See Current keep your docs in sync in under 30 minutes.”
   - Button: “Get started free”.

Implementation:
- Use Tailwind utility classes for layout and spacing.
- Must be responsive on mobile (stacked sections).
- Export a default React component for this page.
- Tone: simple, confident, non-jargony but clearly AI-powered.
