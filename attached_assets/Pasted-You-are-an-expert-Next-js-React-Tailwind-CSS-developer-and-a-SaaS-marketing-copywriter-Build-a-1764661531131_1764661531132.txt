You are an expert Next.js + React + Tailwind CSS developer and a SaaS marketing copywriter.

Build a `/solutions` page for a B2B SaaS product called **Current**.

Context:
- Current is a self-updating knowledge base.
- It ingests Slack, Zoom, and documents (Google Docs / Notion / Confluence).
- It detects knowledge drift and suggests AI-powered updates to SOPs and internal documentation.
- Target buyers: Ops, Customer Success, RevOps, Agencies, HR/Onboarding teams at mid-market SaaS and services companies.

General requirements:
- Use React + Tailwind CSS (no external UI libraries).
- Export a default React component (e.g. `export default function SolutionsPage()`).
- Assume this will live in a Next.js project (`/app/solutions/page.tsx` or `/pages/solutions.tsx`).
- Focus on clean, enterprise-grade design (Linear / Notion / Glean vibes).
- Responsive layout for mobile + desktop.

Page structure:

1) Hero section
   - Full-width section at top.
   - Headline: “Solutions for teams who can’t afford stale documentation.”
   - Subheadline: One or two sentences explaining that Current helps different teams keep their knowledge accurate and in sync with how they actually work.
   - Primary CTA button: “Get started free”
   - Secondary CTA link: “Talk to us”
   - Optional subtle text: “Built for ops, CS, RevOps, agencies, and HR.”

2) Solutions overview grid
   - A grid (2x3 or 3x2 on desktop, stacked on mobile) of solution cards for different personas:
     - Ops Teams
     - Customer Success
     - RevOps
     - Agencies & Services
     - HR & Onboarding
   - Each card should include:
     - Title (e.g. “Ops Teams”)
     - 1–2 sentence description of their pain and how Current helps (e.g. keeping SOPs and process docs aligned with fast-changing reality).
     - 3 bullet points of specific benefits.
     - A “Learn more” link or button that *would* go to a persona-specific page (e.g. `/solutions/ops`), but for now just uses a `#` placeholder.

   Example copy themes:
   - Ops Teams: prevent process drift, reduce errors, keep SOPs current.
   - CS Teams: keep onboarding and playbooks in sync with what top reps actually do.
   - RevOps: ensure GTM teams always have the latest processes and rules of engagement.
   - Agencies: keep client playbooks and internal how-tos updated without manual cleanup.
   - HR & Onboarding: ensure new hires always see the real, current way things are done.

3) Deep-dive band (“Why teams choose Current”)
   - A two-column section.
   - Left column: short heading and 2–3 paragraphs on shared pains across these teams:
     - Knowledge spread across Slack, Zoom, and random docs.
     - Docs that go stale within weeks.
     - Operational risk when people rely on outdated SOPs.
   - Right column: a simple checklist or highlight list of cross-cutting benefits:
     - “AI-powered drift detection”
     - “Human-in-the-loop approvals”
     - “Version history and diffs”
     - “Works with your existing tools”
   - Use Tailwind to style this as a clean content section with good spacing.

4) Mini “solution stories” row
   - A section with 3 horizontal cards (stacked on mobile) that each read like a mini-story:
     - Example 1: “Ops team rolls out a new process across 4 regions without rewriting docs.”
     - Example 2: “CS team updates onboarding journeys after product changes — without hunting through Notion.”
     - Example 3: “Agency standardizes client playbooks while processes change weekly.”
   - Each card:
     - A short bold heading (the scenario).
     - 3–4 lines describing the before/after with Current.
   - These are not real customers yet, just realistic narratives.

5) Callout for mid-market & scaling teams
   - A narrow band that explicitly calls out your ICP:
     - “Designed for teams of 20–500 people who are growing fast and tired of stale documentation.”
   - Include 3 small pill-style bullets:
     - “Ops & CS led rollouts”
     - “Works alongside Notion/Confluence”
     - “Fast to pilot, easy to expand”

6) Final CTA section
   - Simple full-width section near the bottom.
   - Headline: “See how Current fits your team.”
   - Subheadline: Emphasize that in under 30 minutes they can see their own processes and docs start to sync.
   - Buttons:
     - Primary: “Get started free”
     - Secondary: “Book a demo”

Implementation notes:
- Use Tailwind for layout, spacing, and typography (e.g. `max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4 py-16` patterns).
- Use semantic HTML (`<main>`, `<section>`, `<h1>`/`<h2>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`).
- Keep all copy focused on real business pains and ROI, not technical jargon.
- Make sure the page looks polished and trustworthy enough for a mid-market buyer to show to their team.
