You are an expert SaaS marketing designer and front-end engineer working on the homepage for Current — an AI self-updating knowledge base for internal company docs.

The stack is React + Tailwind (assume Next.js-style components and modern best practices).
Your job is to update the existing homepage to clearly communicate:

The cost of out-of-date / hard-to-update knowledge bases

The time, money, and morale lost today

The ROI of Current in a simple, compelling way for mid-market buyers

Brand & Audience

Product name: Current

Tagline concept: “Self-updating knowledge for fast-moving teams.”

Target buyer: VP/Head of Operations, CS, RevOps, Enablement, or COO at mid-market SaaS or tech-enabled companies (100–1000 employees)

Tone: sharp, confident, data-backed, no fluff. Think: “Notion + Vanta + Snowflake ROI slide.”

1. Layout & Structure

Update the homepage to include these sections, in this order (you can integrate into existing layout but keep this narrative):

Hero (short, punchy, with 1–2 power stats)

The Problem: Knowledge Bases Are Failing (data-backed)

The Cost: Time, Money, Morale (simple, quantified)

The ROI of Current (clear 15–60× ROI, with a mid-market example)

Mini ROI Snapshot / Calculator CTA (invite them to “See your ROI”)

Trust / Social Proof Placeholder (logos or quote area)

Use Tailwind, modern spacing, and responsive design. Use cards, big numbers, and bold headings. Do not invent new statistics — only use the ones provided below (you may lightly round or simplify for readability, e.g., 5.2M → 5M).

2. Copy & Stats to Use (Verbatim or Lightly Edited)

Use this content as your source of truth:

HERO

Goal: Make the value obvious in 5 seconds.

Main headline:
Your knowledge base is bleeding you millions. Current stops the leak.

Subheadline:
Current automatically updates your SOPs, playbooks, and onboarding docs from Slack, meetings, and scattered files — so your team stops searching, stops guessing, and starts executing.

1–2 stat callouts (small badges or pill components), for example:

“Employees spend 20–30% of their week just searching for information.”

“Mid-market teams lose $3M–$7M/year to out-of-date documentation.”

Primary CTA: “Book a demo”

Secondary CTA: “See your ROI in 60 seconds”

SECTION 1: The Problem – Knowledge Bases Are Failing

Add a section with a strong headline and 3–4 stat cards.

Headline:
“Your ‘source of truth’ is out of date by the end of the quarter.”

Subcopy (short paragraph):
Most companies treat documentation as a one-time project. Docs are written once, then forgotten. The result: stale SOPs, tribal knowledge in Slack, and teams who can’t trust what they read.

Stats to surface as cards:

80% of company knowledge is stale within 90 days.

Employees spend 20–30% of their week searching for information.

40% of knowledge walks out the door when someone leaves.

67% of employees say outdated documentation directly causes mistakes.

Visually, make these look like “Oh shit” stats: big number, small descriptor line, short explanation.

SECTION 2: The Cost – Time, Money, Morale

Goal: Show the economic pain clearly, especially for a 250-person company.

Headline:
“The status quo is costing you millions every year.”

Subcopy:
Even conservative assumptions show that out-of-date, hard-to-update knowledge bases quietly drain millions of dollars in productivity, rework, and morale every single year.

Create a 3-column layout for Time, Money, Morale, and then a simple table for the mid-market example.

Time / Productivity:

Employees waste 8–12 hours per week searching for information and asking clarifying questions.

For a 250-person company, that’s ~2,500 hours/week, or $100K/week at ~$40/hr fully loaded.

That’s ~$5.2M/year in lost productivity.

Money / Rework & Onboarding:

Mistakes from outdated info and tribal knowledge cost $4,500 per incident on average.

Mid-market orgs see 25–40 incidents/month → $112K–$180K/month in rework.

Poor documentation slows ramp, increasing time-to-productivity by 30–60%.

Each new hire loses $15K–$25K in slow ramp. At 20 hires/year, that’s $300K–$500K/year lost.

Morale / Retention:

34% of employees say poor documentation “severely impacts morale.”

22% cite it as a reason for burnout or attrition.

Replacing one burned-out employee costs $50K–$150K.

Add a simple “Cost Snapshot” table like:

“250 employees”

“$5.2M/year in lost productivity”

“$1M–$1.5M/year in rework & slow onboarding”

“Silent tax on every project, every new hire, every customer.”

SECTION 3: The ROI of Current

Goal: Show 15–60× ROI with a clear, believable example.

Headline:
“Current pays for itself in days, not months.”

Subcopy:
Current turns your chaotic, stale documentation into a living system that updates itself from the tools your team already uses.

Use the following value pillars, each with specific numbers:

Cuts search time by 40–75%

If employees waste 8–12 hours/week searching, Current gives back 5–9 hours/week.

That’s 20–36 hours/month per employee — roughly 4–8% productivity improvement.

For a 250-person team, that’s $2M–$4M/year in reclaimed productivity.

Eliminates 60–90% of rework incidents

Current keeps SOPs and playbooks up to date by automatically:

ingesting Slack, meetings, and docs

updating steps & screenshots

surfacing changes and discrepancies.

This can save $75K–$160K/month in rework and error costs.

Accelerates onboarding by 30–50%

New hires get a current, trustworthy single source of truth.

At 20 hires/year, this saves $250K–$400K annually in ramp-time cost.

Retains institutional knowledge

Instead of losing 40% of knowledge when someone leaves, Current keeps it:

Ingesting messages and meetings

Updating docs automatically.

This protects $300K–$800K/year in otherwise lost institutional memory.

Replaces 2–4 FTEs of manual documentation work

Today, PMs, Ops, CSMs, and engineers spend 5–10 hours/week maintaining docs.

That’s $180K–$350K/year of low-leverage work that Current automates.

Total ROI Summary Block (visually big):

Current license (mid-market): ~$10K–$50K/year

Estimated value delivered: $3M–$7M+/year

ROI: 15×–60×

Payback period: < 7 days

Add a concise line:

“Most customers recoup a full year of Current in the first week.”

SECTION 4: Mini ROI Snapshot / Calculator CTA

Add a slim section that teases an interactive calculator (even if it’s just a CTA for now).

Headline:
“See how much Current is worth to your team.”

Subcopy:
“Enter your headcount and we’ll show you how much time and money you’re losing to outdated documentation — and how quickly Current pays for itself.”

Add a CTA button: “See your ROI in 60 seconds” (can scroll to a calculator section, open a modal, or just be a placeholder route).

SECTION 5: Trust / Social Proof Placeholder

Even if we don’t have real logos yet, design the layout so we can drop them in later.

Headline: “Built for teams who can’t afford stale knowledge.”

Subtext: “Logos or customer quotes will live here.”

3. Implementation Details

Use modern, clean Tailwind classes for layout: max-w-5xl, mx-auto, grid, gap-6, etc.

Use cards with big numbers for stats (e.g., text-3xl font-semibold for numbers).

Make sure the new content is:

Responsive and mobile-friendly

Accessible (semantic HTML, good contrast, proper heading hierarchy)

Keep copy concise in the UI (you can slightly trim sentences to avoid walls of text), but preserve all key numbers and claims.

4. Important Constraints

Do not invent new statistics or ROI numbers beyond what’s provided.

You can round for readability (e.g., $5.2M → $5M, “40–75%” → “up to 75%”) but don’t materially change the meaning.

Keep the brand name Current and positioning as “self-updating internal knowledge base.”
